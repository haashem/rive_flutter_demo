# Sample Rive animations in Flutter

This is the accompanying app for my Flutter London Talk on October 25, 2023. It showcases three demos:

* Onboarding: Demonstrates how easily you can create complex animated onboarding flows. It works on both small and large screen devices.

* Chart: Shows data binding in Rive with a simple animated chart, opening the door to creating fully dynamic and interactive charts.
